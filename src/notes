        - (only admin can do this)
            <!-- Route: DELETE /users/:id -->
    need to update users
        - user can update own info
        - admin can update everyones info
            <!-- PUT /users/:id  -->
        IF ID IS THE SAME ID AS LOGGED IN USER, OR THE LOGGEDIN USER IS AN ADMIN, THEY ARE ALLOWED TO UPDATE INFO
